                In the ground, we bury
                The seeds of a pear tree
                All the things we carried
                Now we're down to our bare feet
                May I have this dance to make it up to you?
                Can I say something crazy?
                I love you
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="stanza">
            <pre>
                Give me both your hands to make it up to you
                Let me spin and excite you
                We are bound to inherit
                The sins of our parents
                And all the people we pass through
                Now we're down to the last two
                May I have this dance to make it up to you?
                Can I say something crazy?
                I love you
